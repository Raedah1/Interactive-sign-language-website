# Interactive-sign-language-website
A web application platform for learning and practicing British sign language through incorporating sign gesture detection. The purpose of the website is to provide instant and real-time feedback on their hand signing and to give the users the opportunity to actively practice their signing skills in a more fun and engaging way without relying on others. This project aims to increase the accessibility of sign language learning to a border audience.
